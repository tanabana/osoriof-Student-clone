#About me
I'm a librarian interested in how libraries can use computer science to hlp with workflows and help with their missions: making information more accessible to more people, creating digital archives and libraries to preserve and share information/culture/history.

Web development is a big part of what librariers are doing to reach more users and make their collections more accessible. I'm looking forward to learning more in the class.

C++, C and Assembly were covered in earlier classes. I've spent time on my own with python and took a database class in graduate school that covered php.

It took awhile to figure out how to get here, and I'm still not sure if this was the best way.

I live in DC. I came here after finishing Grad school in Boston and am working as a librarian.

This is my Fourth Quarter. I've taken cs 161, 162, 225, 261 and 271
