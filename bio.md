#About me
I'm a librarian interested in how libraries can use computer science to hlp with workflows and help with their missions: making information more accessible to more people, creating digital archives and libraries to preserve and share information/culture/history.

Web development is a big part of what librariers are doing to reach more users and make their collections more accessible. I'm looking forward to learning more in the class.

#Programming Background

C++, C and Assembly were covered in earlier classes. I've spent time on my own with python and took a database class in graduate school that covered php.
